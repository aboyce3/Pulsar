Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I aint the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an L on her forehead
well the years start coming and they dont shop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didnt make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart and your head gets dumb
so much to do, so much to see 
so what's wrong with taking the back streets?
Youll never Know if you dont go
Youll never shine if you dont glow
